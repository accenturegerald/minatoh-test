## üìç Where to Modify Services

### Quick Answer:
**Admin Page ‚Üí Services Tab**

### Detailed Instructions:
1. Navigate to **Admin** in the main menu
2. Click the **Services** tab (second tab after General)
3. Use these buttons:
   - **Add Service**: Top right "Add Service" button
   - **Edit Service**: Pencil icon next to each service
   - **Delete Service**: Trash icon next to each service

### What You Can Configure:
- **Service Name**: Display name (e.g., "Swedish Massage")
- **Service Type**: Category (Massage, Facial, Body Treatment, Therapy)
- **Duration**: Minutes required (e.g., 60)
- **Price**: Cost to client in dollars (e.g., 80)
- **Commission**: Percentage paid to therapist (e.g., 40)

## üéØ New Features Implemented

### 1. Service Management (CRUD)
- **Location**: Admin ‚Üí Services tab
- Add new services with full details
- Edit existing service information
- Delete services with confirmation
- Real-time updates across the app

### 2. Staff Management with Capabilities
- **Location**: Staff page
- Add new therapists with service capabilities
- Edit existing therapists
- Assign which services each therapist can perform
- Visual checkbox interface for service selection

### 3. Assignment Confirmation Dialog
- **Location**: Walk-in page
- Shows complete assignment details
- Calculates buffer times automatically
- Warns about delays for busy staff
- Displays estimated start times

### 4. Busy Staff Selection
- **Location**: Walk-in page
- Can now select busy/on-break staff
- Shows "Free at [time]" with buffer calculation
- Auto-calculates 12-minute escort buffer
- Clear visual indicators

## üìä How the System Works

### Priority Algorithm (Corrected)
When assigning a walk-in:
1. **Filter by service capability** - Only show staff who can perform the service
2. **Filter by gender preference** - Match client's preference
3. **Sort by availability** - Available staff appear first
4. **Sort by commission** - ‚≠ê **LOWER commission = HIGHER priority**
5. **Sort by serves today** - Fewer serves = higher priority
6. **Tie-breaker** - Longest time since last service wins

### Buffer Time Calculations
- **Escort Buffer**: 12 minutes (constant)
- **Late Threshold**: 15 minutes (configurable)
- **Room Buffer**: 15 minutes (configurable)

When assigning to a busy therapist:
```
Start Time = Current Client End Time + Escort Buffer (12 min)
```
